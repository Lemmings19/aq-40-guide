It is important to note that it is based on a rogue’s perspective, but could be helpful for other classes as well since everything will be covered in detail. Given how the raid is scaling more in difficulty compared to what we have completed so far, along with the fact that is extremely vast, I have tried to make this guide as intuitive and correct as possible. Due to the length and depth of this guide, I would highly recommend that you navigate using the number designations under ‘Contents’ and Ctrl + F to find the encounter of interest. I also want to mention that I have never cleared AQ40 before, meaning that some information or strategies that I have included might be incorrect. Feel free to provide suggestions if you see something that can be changed/improved - I’m more than happy make adjustments accordingly. Thank you!<br><br><br>

Nature resistance is required in some encounters, but the value will vary depending on raid composition, the amount of healers as well as strategy used. A general rule of thumb is to acquire 255 NR unbuffed (resistance enchants included), but some pieces can be swapped with DPS alternatives when appropriate. <a href="http://vanguard-kronos.shivtr.com/forum_threads/2319563" rel="nofollow">List of Nature Resistance gear</a><br><br>Nature Resistance Potions along with Engineering items (grenades, explosives etc.) are highly encouraged to use throughout the dungeon. Furthermore, there will be items and consumables required in specific encounters. These are listed later in the guide.<br><br><br>

These can be revealed by using Detect Magic. Each time a <span style="color: #ffff33;">Sentinel</span> falls, the remainder will gain its ability and heal for 50% of their maximum health.

Every aspect of this fight must be managed and controlled perfectly in order to ensure success. Because of the 10 minute hard enrage timer, DPS and survivability is extremely important. The boss and her adds will be positioned according to the figure above. The encounter is divided into two phases - the first one revolves around dealing with the adds, whereas the second one is killing the boss.<br><br>In the first phase, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sartura</span> and her adds will first be separated - the main tank holds aggro on <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sartura</span> in a location back in the room, whereas the remainder of the tanks and furies set up a taunt rotation on the adds to ensure that they are not targetting random raid members. Furthermore, rogues and paladins will assist the tanks by alternating stuns on the add that is being killed using <span style="color: #2cff00;">Kidney Shot</span> and <span style="color: #2cff00;">Hammer of Justice</span>. <span style="color: #2cff00;">Grenades</span> can also be used for the same purpose, however with less reliability. During this time, the adds need to be burned down with focused DPS, killing one by one. Since they have no aggro list, there is no need to worry about threat issues. In addition, every raid member needs to be aware of the positioning of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Satura</span> and her adds. If a bug is approaching you, it is imperative that you start running quickly in one direction, thus reducing the chances of getting hit since it is likely to change direction due to its random pathing.<br><br>When the adds have died, the second phase begins. The raid needs to spread out in a circular way to minimize AoE damage taken from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sartura</span>. It is crucial that <span style="color: #2cff00;">Detect Magic</span> is applied consistently throughout the fight in order to monitor her <span style="color: #2cff00;">Whirlwind</span>. Anyone near <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sartura</span> will take massive damage, meaning that the healing strain will become much worse along with melees being required to run away of her range occasionally. She is also vulnerable to stuns while not in her <span style="color: #2cff00;">Whirlwind</span> state and rogues/paladins should therefore focus on this throughout the fight. At 20%, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sartura</span> enters her soft enrage state, greatly increasing her damage on tanks and melees. Healers should try to conserve their mana until this point, and melees can use <span style="color: #2cff00;">Limited Invulnerability Potion</span> while in danger to optimize DPS.<br><br>

These hit for 300 on tanks, 800-900 on cloth and can be snared or feared. They will need to be off-tanked for most of the fight. If the <span style="color: #ffff33;">Vekniss Hatchlings</span> get loose, they need to get killed or kited. It is preferable to kill them in early stages of the fight and kited later on, for example using <span style="color: #2cff00;">Frost Trap</span> or fears. They cannot be snared.<br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/inv_misc_food_17.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"><span style="color: #2cff00;">  Summon Worm:</span> At random times during the fight, one to three yellow-colored level 63 Elite worms called <span style="color: #ffff33;">Spawn of Fankriss</span> will spawn periodically in a random location. These hit for around 2000 on cloth and will enrage after 20 seconds, increasing attack and movement speed by 150% and all damage by 500% with taunt immunity. Enraged worms will one-shot anybody they are on, dealing 10-20k per hit. They are extremely important in this encounter as they must be killed immediately. However, since they are vulnerable to stuns, it is possible to salvage the situation even after they enrage.<br><br><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Strategy</span></span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Fankriss</span> is a chaotic battle. It requires a combination of excellent crowd control, split second reactions and good DPS. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fankriss</span> must be  tanked in the middle of the room to avoid drawing aggro from the <span style="color: #ffff33;">Drones</span> in the tunnel. The battle starts off slowly and becomes more intensive as it progresses. <br><br>Two tanks will be on <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fankriss</span> due to the application of a healing reduction debuff (<span style="color: #2cff00;">Mortal Wound</span>) on whoever is tanking him. It can stack up to ten times for a total of 100%, rendering all heals useless. One will take him until he has about four to five stacks of the debuff and thereafter the second tank will taunt off in order to allow it to wear off. This will continue until <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fankriss</span> is dead.<br><br>In the meantime, the rest of the raid should be dealing as much damage to<span style="color: #ff0000;"> Fankriss</span> as possible. However, it is important that the <span style="color: #ffff33;">Vekniss Hatchlings</span> are dealt with if they accumulate, using crowd control (predominantly AoE fears) and off-tanks picking them up right after a player has been entangled. Depending on the DPS, these are fairly easy to handle and most of the focus should be put on damaging <span style="color: #ffff33;">Fankriss</span> and keeping them away from the casters/healers.<br><br>The final and most crucial aspect of this encounter is the <span style="color: #ffff33;">Spawns of Fankriss</span>. These Elite worms spawn periodically and attack the raid. This should be a priority for all DPS, and the attention must be shifted to these in order to kill them as quickly as possible. These have 34K HP and enrage after 20 seconds, dealing lethal amounts of damage. They are however vulnerable to stuns and should be crowd controlled as much as possible have they not been killed at this stage.<br><br>In summary, it is important that the damage is always strong on <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fankriss</span>, that the tanks are transitioned properly along with controlling the <span style="color: #ffff33;">Hatchlings</span> and dealing with the <span style="color: #ffff33;">Spawns</span> promptly. Also note that the waves of bugs have to be dealt with after <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fankriss</span> dies and should be crowd controlled and killed to mitigate deaths.<br><br>

Every rogue and warrior needs to have NR gear in excess, approximately 255 unbuffed for rogues. At the start of the encounter, two tanks will be at the front with the boss turned away from the raid at all times. A tank switch is necessary occasionally because of her <span style="color: #2cff00;">Acid Spit</span>. This is because it stacks infinitely and cannot be resisted, along with the fact that it deals substantial damage after only a few stacks. The debuff lasts for 30 seconds. In addition, hunters need to use <span style="color: #2cff00;">Tranquilizing Sho</span>t as soon as she goes into <span style="color: #2cff00;">Frenzy</span>.<br><br>The 15 players closest to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Huhuran</span> (predominantly melees and tanks) should have their full NR gear and take up their positions immediately. The casters and remaining players will then move into position behind <span style="color: #ff0000;">Huhuran</span>. Depending on the raid composition, e.g. the amount of healers, some NR gear can be swapped out for DPS gear. <span style="color: #2cff00;">Wyvern Sting</span> is an important skill to keep track of - it is an AoE sleep effect that will hit the ten closest people. It is extremely imperative not to dispel anyone but the tanks since it causes 3000 damage instantly, however can be resisted. Due to the fact that the boss cannot be taunted, it has to be removed from the tank that is trying to get aggro.<br><br>It is a relatively simple fight until she reaches 30%. Therefore, it is possible for rogues to equip regular gear prior to reaching 30%, thereafter using <span style="color: #2cff00;">Vanish</span> and changing to NR gear when appropriate. When she reaches this point, she enters a <span style="color: #2cff00;">Berserk</span> phase and begins to shoot <span style="color: #2cff00;">Poison Bolts</span> onto the closest fifteen players. High Nature Resistance as well as <span style="color: #2cff00;">Prayer of Healing</span> is crucial here.

Use a hunter to pull <span style="color: #ff0000;">Vek’nilash</span> to 1-2 warrior tank(s) and use 1-2 warlock(s) to secure aggro on<span style="color: #ff0000;"> Vek’lor</span>. It is important that the whole raid understands and reacts to all of their attacks, most notably moving out of <span style="color: #2cff00;">Blizzard</span>, avoiding <span style="color: #2cff00;">Arcane Burst</span> by staying away from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Vek’lor</span> in addition to the bug dynamic and the <span style="color: #2cff00;">Twin Teleport</span>.  <br><br>This is a long fight, meaning that it cannot be rushed. Perfect execution outweighs any sort of speed and prevents wipes. The majority of the casters should position themselves on the stairs, healing the main tanks and defeating enraged bugs. If <span style="color: #ff0000;">Vek’lor</span> unleashes a <span style="color: #2cff00;">Blizzard</span> upon the stairs, it is crucial that it is moved out from swiftly or it will most definitely result deaths. <span style="color: #2cff00;">Greater Frost Protection Potion</span> is extremely useful during this battle and should be used as much as possible to mitigate the damage.<br><br>It is important that no AoE abilities are used at all during this fight since they usually hit the bugs, making the others in the vicinity to aggro.

In the case of the neutral bugs getting pulled, gather them up and kill them quickly with AoE spells before anymore can aggro.<br><br>All damage classes have significant roles in this encounter. There is a setup for each of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Emperors</span> and it needs to be executed perfectly, making sure that they are controlled at all times during <span style="color: #2cff00;">Twin Teleport.</span><br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Vek’nilash:</span> This Emperor will be tanked by warriors, but they need to ensure that they have above 400 defense each and have their backs against a wall to prevent them from flying backwards. Once aggro has been solidified on the MT, the melee DPS will start attacking the boss. When the teleport is closing in, around 5 seconds before, the second warrior tank will head over to the opposite teleport point to pick up the aggro as soon as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Vek’nilash</span> appears. The melee DPS will also move to the other side at this point. This will be repeated throughout the whole fight.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Vek’lor:</span> Since this Emperor is immune to physical damage, it will be tanked by warlocks with high Shadow Resistance gear and linked to their Voidwalkers. As soon as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Vek’lor</span> appears at the teleport spot, the assigned warlock must begin chain-casting <span style="color: #2cff00;">Searing Pain</span> to draw his <span style="color: #2cff00;">Shadow Bolt</span>. It is important that nobody is in his melee range to prevent <span style="color: #2cff00;">Arcane Burst</span> from being cast. <br><br>It is important that the raid group allows both the warrior and warlock tank for each side to cement aggro before the rest of the raid begins attacking after <span style="color: #2cff00;">Twin Teleport.</span> In addition, it is important to move away the exploding bugs from the raid as well as promptly killing the mutated bugs to prevent unnecessary deaths.<br><br>

Can be dispelled.<br><br><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Strategy</span></span><br><br>The first enemy that needs to be focused is the Mindslayer. These often cast Mind Flay, resulting in significant strain on the healers. It is immune to taunt, so it is important to make sure that the tank has generated enough aggro before burning it down. The players affected must promptly be polymorphed or stunned immediately to prevent deaths. The Mindslayer should be pulled away from the raid before it dies to minimize the fear, damage and mana draining effect from Mana Burn.<br><br>Next, the Slayers need to be eliminated. Make sure that they are tanked away from the casters at all costs since they have an AoE silencing spell when under the effect of Frenzy. This also ensures that only the tank is being cleaved. In the meantime, hunters need to pay special attention to the Qiraji Slayers since they enrage often, requiring a Tranquilizing Shot. A hunter should be assigned to each and wary of their positioning. Every fifteen seconds or so the Slayer knocks the tank away, causing the Slayer to attack whoever is second on their aggro list. This effect can be mitigated by tanking it while their back is facing a wall.<br><br>The final kill will be the Qiraji Champion. Keep him tanked away from the raid using two tanks with their backs against a wall due to the knockback. Fear Ward needs to be applied on the tank as much as possible. The final ability to watch out for is Vengeance when the Champion reaches low hitpoints. This will cause him to enter an enraged state and should be dispelled immediately to prevent unnecessary damage on the tank.<br><br>

They come in packs of 1 Anubisath Warder and 2 Obsidian Nullifiers and there will be 3 pulls in total. While it may seem a bit daunting at first, this trio is easily dispatched if handled correctly. They follow the same trend as the other Anubisath and Obsidian mobs encountered in AQ - the Anubisath Warder selects a random ability at the beginning of combat. It will choose 1 out of 2 abilities from 2 distinct sets. The Warder will reset its abilities if the raid wipes. The Nullifiers have an ability that is triggered when they reach full mana, and they acquire that from draining it from the raid.<br><br><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="color: #ffff33;">Anubisath Warder</span></span><br><br><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Abilities and Attacks</span></span><br><br><strong>Set 1: <span style="color: #2cff00;">Entangling Roots</span> &amp; <span style="color: #2cff00;">Fear</span></strong><br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/spell_nature_stranglevines.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"><span style="color: #2cff00;">  Entangling Roots:</span> Immobilizes a large quantity of the raid for a long duration. Ranges at least 30 yds from the mob and occurs periodically. This is detrimental to the melee classes if they become rooted out of range of anything they can hit. <br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/spell_shadow_possession.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"><span style="color: #2cff00;">  Fear:</span> Fears a large quantity of the raid for up to 8 seconds. Ranges at least 30 yds from the mob and occurs periodically.  Fear Ward should be ready at all times for the warrior tanking the Warder. You obviously do not want your raid to get feared while damaging and draining the Nullifiers since time is of the essence.<br><br><strong>Set 2: <span style="color: #2cff00;">Dust Cloud</span> &amp; <span style="color: #2cff00;">Silence</span></strong><br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_hibernation.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"><span style="color: #2cff00;">  Dust Cloud:</span> Reduces the chance to hit by 85%. Since these are level 63+ mobs, this essentially stops all melee damage. Make sure melees are not afflicted by this while they are attempting to defeat the Nullifiers.<br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/spell_holy_silence.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"><span style="color: #2cff00;">  Silence:</span> Stops all casting in the raid.<br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/spell_fire_sealoffire.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"><span style="color: #2cff00;"> Fire Nova:</span> Deals significant AoE Fire damage to anyone in the vicinity.

When used in conjunction with a Warder’s Fire Nova, this can lead to many deaths. Additionally, Nullify removes all buffs from afflicted players, including Soulstones and Ice Block.<br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/spell_shadow_chilltouch.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"><span style="color: #2cff00;">  Drain Mana:</span> Continually drains mana from the raid group, filling up their own mana bar as a result.<br><br><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Strategy</span></span><br><br>The Obsidian Nullifiers should be the first to die and they must be dispatched promptly to prevent them from draining too much mana from the raid along with preventing them from being able to use Nullify. Have everyone in the raid that can drain mana to do so, predominantly priests and warlocks, and split them in half. Half of the raid should be mana draining one target, while the other half drains the other. While this is happening, the tanks should be grabbing their aggro as quickly as possible. All damage should be focused on one Nullifier at a time. If the damage is split over both Obsidians you run out of time before they fill their mana bar. <br><br>The Warder is not an overly powerful foe, but does have a few abilities that can make dealing with the Nullifiers more difficult. Ensure that the Warder is tanked far in front of the raid, so that any abilities the Anubisath has does not affect the raid. Turn the focus to it as soon as the two Obsidian Nullifiers are dead.<br><br>

Once mastered, nobody should die. Executing this phase with near perfection is necessary as well, since you want the majority of your raid group alive when CThun rises.<br><br><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Abilities and Attacks</span></span><br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/spell_nature_callstorm.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"><span style="color: #2cff00;">  Eye Beam:</span> For 50 seconds, C’Thun assaults the raid with a green laser beam, dealing 2.6k-3.4k Nature damage every 3 seconds. Resistible. If this hits one person, they almost always survive. Chains between players that are too close to each other (within roughly 10 yards) and indefinitely increases in damage each time it chains until there are no more players within range of the beam. If two players are near one another, one will take the normal amount of damage, and the next takes even more, estimated to be multiplied by a factor of 1.5. Should this hit more than two players it is 100% fatal. The importance of being spaced out during this phase of C’Thun cannot be stressed enough. The safety range is measured at 15 yards - use the C’Thun Warner addon to verify this. Use Greater Nature Protection Potion to mitigate damage taken during this phase.<br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_siege_engineer_superheated.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"><span style="color: #2cff00;">  Dark Glare:</span>  Deals 43k-56k Shadow Damage on any player who passes through the large beam, which occurs every 45 seconds, extends radially outward from C’Thun during the ‘red’ phase of stage 1. The eye will appear visibly red and slowly rotate 180 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise  The initial target is random, but there are signs of where the glare will begin due to a shadowy cloud appearing in the pupil shortly before the beam is let loose. It is possible to blink through it. <br><br>The moment you see the beam charge up, it is time to start moving. If the Eye is facing you when charging you have about 4 seconds to get out of the way. The Eye Beams stop at this point, so spacing is not necessary until the Dark Glare is finished. Take note of where you are standing before the Dark Glare. Your group, when the Glare is over, should be in the opposite position of the room. After the next Dark Glare, your group should be back in its original position etc.<br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_creature_poison_04.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"><span style="color: #2cff00;">  Spawn Claw Tentacle:</span> Tentacles with 1,500 HP will periodically spawn at random locations with alarming frequencies at various points of C’Thun’s chamber, dealing approximately 200 melee damage per hit and do a one-time knockback attack when they are spawned called Ground Rupture for 1,350 - 1,650 damage. Additionally, they can do a Hamstring attack, making it more difficult to flee from the Dark Glare. Can sometimes knock players into the Dark Glare. The player who gets knocked away must get back into position immediately to keep true to the spacing rule, even if they have to get into melee range of the newly spawned claw. All melee DPS should immediately shift over and destroy it before it can burrow underground again.<br><br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/inv_misc_monsterhorn_02.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"><span style="color: #2cff00;">  Spawn Eye Tentacles:</span> Every 45 seconds CThun summons eight Eye Tentacles with 2,300 HP that remain stationary and equally spaced in a circle around him at the black expanse, knocking back anyone standing within a few yards of their spawn points. It is important to stay away from the area until they actually spawn. These eyes have a Mind Flay spell that deals 750 Shadow damage per second for 3 seconds to a random target, but are susceptible to many crowd control abilities such as Counterspell, Gouge, and stuns. A team of one melee and one caster is enough to kill them in 4 seconds. Other ranged may help, but no more melee or they risk chaining the Eye Beam. Mind Flay be resisted, but its damage won’t be reduced. Abilities that remove slowing effects, e.g. Sprint, counteracts it.<br><br><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Strategy</span></span><br><br><a href="http://i.imgur.com/I3tWiO3.png" rel="colorbox"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/I3tWiO3.png"></a><br><strong>Illustration of the raid placement and movement on C’Thun.</strong><br><br>When first entering C’Thun’s chamber, the best strategy is to shield a player with high NR and have him enter the room ahead of the rest of the raid. This will cause the first few Eye Beams to hit this particular player while giving the rest of the raid a chance to get into position. A hunter is ideal for this due to their +60 NR aura (Aspect of the Wild) as well as ability to FD and equip regular gear. If the raid enters the room at the same time it is likely that a large portion will die from a chained Eye Beam. An alternative is to use a tank with priest shield and Greater Nature Protection Potion.<br><br>Once in position, the ranged DPS burn away at the Eye of C’Thun with maximum DPS. The Eye itself as no aggro properties or way to deal damage other than the Eye Beams and Dark Glare. When Claw Tentacles and Eye Tentacles spawn it is the duty of everyone, but the ranged DPS to deal with them.<br><br>When the Dark Glare comes, shift the raid clockwise or counterclockwise accordingly. Make sure you are in position a good 5 seconds before the Glare is over. Once over, the Eye Beams begins again in full force. During Dark Glare a few warriors should rush into melee range with the Eye while they move and apply five Sunder Armors, increasing the melee DPS. Repeat these step until the Eye is dead.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Phase 2 - C'Thun</span></span><br><br><a href="http://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/502266-cthun.jpg" rel="colorbox"><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/502266-cthun.jpg"></a><br><br>When the Eye of C’Thun dies, C’Thun rises. If no tentacle is alive at this point, players are taken out of combat and are encouraged to drink during this transition. During this phase, C’Thun has a shield that reduces all damage by 99%. In order to bring the shield down and damage it, players must engage the stomach from inside. This is an extremely long battle, and the success rate is determined by how fast the raid can react to the chaos around them.<br><br>Several things are similar to the Eye phase, but usually in larger and more powerful quantities. The largest difference is that the spacing rules no longer apply due to Eye Beam not existing during this phase. The body of C’Thun himself has no real abilities to speak of, but there will be many things around you that demand immediate and proper reactions or things can get out of hand quickly.<br><br><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Abilities and Attacks</span></span><br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_creature_poison_04.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"><span style="color: #2cff00;">  Spawn Giant Claw Tentacle:</span> Once every minute, with a 30 second off-set from Giant Eye Tentacle spawns,  an enormous version of the Claw Tenticle spawns with 90,000 HP, appearing at a random person’s feet and dealing 3,000 - 4,000 knock away damage through Ground Rupture to anyone caught above it when it surfaces. This must be tanked immediately since it deals 1,500 damage on a well-geared tank and also have a Thrash ability (two extra attacks) that can one-shot someone with low armor. Whichever warrior is closest should engage it within 5 seconds. If left above ground with no target for too long, it heals to full and burrows under, only to spawn again shortly and use the Ground Rupture ability again. Ranged DPS cannot pull aggro on these, so they should attack immediately. Rogues and other melee DPS, however, should wait for aggro to be established. Kill the tentacle as quickly as possible, but do not ignore the other things happening in the chamber. Although they are important to get down, they are actually the lowest priority of things to kill. There appears to be no cap on the number of tentacles that can be spawned at one time. <br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/inv_misc_monsterhorn_02.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"><span style="color: #2cff00;">  Spawn Giant Eye Tentacle:</span> Once every minute, with a 30 second off-set from Giant Claw Tentacle spawns, C’Thun will summon a Giant Eye Tentacle with 36,000 HP. They have an identical Ground Rupture ability upon spawning, and also melees just as hard. They repeatedly cast the Eye Beam ability that the Eye of C’Thun uses in Phase 1, but are susceptible to a wide range of crowd control abilities like their small version. There appears to be no cap on the number of tentacles that can be spawned simultaneously. Since the whole raid is packed together to deal with these, players are vulnerable to Eye Beam. It is therefore imperative that they are permanently stunlocked and killed fast.<br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/inv_misc_monsterhorn_02.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"><span style="color: #2cff00;">  Spawn Eye Tentacles:</span> As in phase one, C’Thun summons the eight smaller Eye Tentacles around him. However, they spawn every 30 seconds now. Eliminating these is the highest priority as they can result in tremendous damage on the raid. While most of the DPS will be concentrated in one part of the room, taking down Giant Claws and Giant Eyes, the Mages should spread out around the room and be ready to destroy these Tentacles promptly. Some of the DPS must take these down within 5 seconds, or the raid is likely to wipe.<br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/spell_deathknight_gnaw_ghoul.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"><span style="color: #2cff00;">  Consume:</span> Every 10 seconds, a tentacle will emerge and swallow a random person in the raid, placing them in C’Thun’s stomach. You fall from the top of the room into green acid, and are given a stacking debuff called Digestive Acid, dealing significant Nature damage. While in the stomach, there are two Flesh Tentacles near two islands with a melee attack and 25,000 HP each that need to be killed in order to make C’Thun vulnerable to attacks. Some classes are better at this than others.  If the Flesh Tentacles are not destroyed together, they will respawn after 1 minute. <br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_creature_disease_02.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"><span style="color: #2cff00;">  Digestive Acid:</span> Stackable debuff dealing 150 Nature damage every 3 seconds per stack when inside C’Thun’s stomach. It reapplies itself every 4 seconds and stacks up to 99 times. Cannot be mitigated by resistances. Pay attention to your health and leave before it stacks too greatly. Nobody should die in the stomach. Greater Nature Protection Potions help to increase the time that you can be inside the stomach.<br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_rogue_findweakness.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"><span style="color: #2cff00;">  Weakened C'Thun:</span> After killing the Flesh Tentacle’s in C’Thun’s stomach, he turns purple and becomes vulnerable for 45 seconds. This phase needs to be use to burn him down. If there is a Giant Claw alive, don’t stop tanking it. During the weakened phase, C’Thun doesn’t spawn any more tentacles. At the end of the phase, C’Thun regains its shield and the Flesh Tentacles respawn in his stomach along with a Giant Claw Tentacle 10 seconds in his chamber afterwards. If done correctly, 2-3 weakened states are required to kill him.<br><br><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Strategy</span></span><br>This battle boils down to discipline and reaction. If the Tentacles are destroyed with the correct priority, method (refer to the explanations above) and correct timing, things should never get out of hand. As stated, the killing order of the Tentacles is as follows: Eye Tentacles first, Giant Eye Tentacles second and Giant Claw Tentacles last. Assignments should be made accordingly.<br><br>The only classes that should stop to damage the Flesh Tentacles in C’Thun’s stomach are the ranged DPS classes and rogues with Evasion available. Healers and melee should apply a DoT before immediately stepping on the pad behind the Tentacles to resurface above. Make sure to position yourself at the center to avoid getting bounced against the wall and killed. <br><br>It is imperative that the Flesh Tentacles are killed right after a Giant Claw Tentacle has died, a Giant Eye Tentacle is dead or near dead, and the smaller Eye Tentacles recently eliminated, in order to make sure that the DPS on C’Thun in his weakened state is optimized rather than dealing with these.<br><br>

Each of the three share a loot table, but each has its own unique loot as well that will only come into play if they are defeat last. This allows the encounter to become expontentially more challenging if certain items are sought after. The easiest way is to kill Lord Kri first, then Princess Yauj and finally Vem. The hardest way is to kill Lord Kri last.<br><br><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Preparation</span></span><br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/inv_potion_22.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"><span style="color: #2cff00;">   Greater Nature Protection Potion</span> x2 (One pre-popped, one if the first one has been depleted)<br><br><img src="%20http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/inv_potion_12.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"> <span style="color: #2cff00;">Elixir of Poison Resistance</span> Used for the purpose of dispelling the Poison DoT during the encounter (does not share cooldown with other consumables and can currently be used indefinitely on Kronos without incurring the intended cooldown.

The simple solution to this is to use two tanks to alternate between the threat and ensuring that he’s kept under control throughout the fight.<br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_warrior_charge.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"> <span style="color: #2cff00;">Berserker Charge:</span> Charges at a random target, knocking it back and dealing normal damage plus 300<br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_golemthunderclap.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"> <span style="color: #2cff00;">Knockdown:</span> Deals minimal damage to an enemy and its nearby allies, stunning them for 2 seconds. Afflicts up to 5 targets.<br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/spell_shadow_unholyfrenzy.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"> <span style="color: #2cff00;">Berserk:</span> After about 20 minutes, Vem will enrage if not killed at that point, increasing attack speed by 150% and the physical damage he deals by 500. Likely to result in a wipe.<br> <br><strong>Death Special</strong><br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/spell_shadow_unholyfrenzy.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"> <span style="color: #2cff00;">Vengeance:</span> Enrages Yauj and Kri if they are still alive, increasing their attack speed by 150% and physical damage by 100%.<br><br><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Princess Yauj</span></span><br><br><a href="http://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/small/50886.jpg" rel="colorbox"><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/small/50886.jpg"></a><br><br><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Abilities and Attacks</span></span><br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_ghoulfrenzy.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"> <span style="color: #2cff00;">Basic Melee:</span> Standard melee attack, dealing ~1000 damage on tanks.<br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/spell_shadow_possession.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"> <span style="color: #2cff00;">Fear:</span> Periodically fears players for 8 seconds in an AoE, wiping aggro even if mitigated with Berserker Rage or Fear Ward. Requires at least two Dwarf priests to counteract this effect. Can reset the boss encounter if displaced too much toward the entrance, meaning that she must be tanked far away from the raid at all times. Have a secondary tank ready to taunt her immediately using Berserker Rage/Fear Ward and take her back to her position until another Fear occurs. It is useful to have an extra tank standing ready in the middle of the room and close to the casters to prevent casualties in the case of taunt resists and due to her high movement speed.<br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/spell_holy_heal.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"> <span style="color: #2cff00;">Great Heal:</span> Princess Yauj periodically heals herself or her other allies for 70-80K with a 2-second casting time, emitting a golden glow from her claws. The spell is interruptible and it must be done without exception. Mortal Strike will halve the effects of the heal, but it is always preferred to interrupt it.<br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_ghoulfrenzy.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"> <span style="color: #2cff00;">Ravage:</span> Inflicts normal damage plus 3 to the player on top of the aggro list, stunning and knocking them down for 2 seconds. Can potentially be mitigated by the usage of Free Action Potion.<br><br><strong>Death Special</strong><br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/trade_engineering.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"> <span style="color: #2cff00;">Summon Yauj Brood:</span> Ten Yauj Brood spawn when Princess Yauj is killed. Each Brood has a Headbutt ability that deals 250-450 damage and interrupts spellcasting for 5 seconds. AoE spells, crowd control and quick shields and heals on the casters will be enough to deal with them.<br><br><span style="font-size: 14px;"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">Lord Kri</span></span><br><br><a href="http://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/303483-lord-kri.jpg" rel="colorbox"><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/303483-lord-kri.jpg"></a><br><br><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Abilities and Attacks</span></span><br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_ghoulfrenzy.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"> <span style="color: #2cff00;">Basic Melee:</span> Standard melee attack, dealing moderate damage on tanks.<br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_warrior_cleave.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"> <span style="color: #2cff00;">Cleave:</span> Hits the primary target and up to three additional targets in his frontal arc for base damage + 189. Keep all other melee DPS behind him to avoid this.<br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_ghoulfrenzy.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"> <span style="color: #2cff00;">Thrash:</span> Gives Lord Kri a chance to get two additional attacks, similar to the effect of Ironfoe.<br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/spell_nature_corrosivebreath.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"> <span style="color: #2cff00;">Toxic Volley:</span> Kri constantly inflicts the raid with bolts of poison that deal 500 Nature damage initially and apply a stackable DoT that hits for 150 every 2 seconds per application. The DoT is dispellable by normal means and stacks indefinitely. Elixir of Poison Resistance or Restorative Potion is a must. Greater Nature Protection Potions also help mitigate the damage.<br><br><strong>Death Special</strong><br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_creature_disease_02.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"> <span style="color: #2cff00;">Toxic Cloud:</span> When Lord Kri dies, he leaves behind a cloud of fatal gas that inflicts 2000 Nature damage per second. Avoid it at all costs. Note that the visuals do not necessarily represent the the whole damaging zone - exercise caution.<br><br><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Strategy</span></span><br><br>Different strategies must be employed according to the order of which the three bugs are being killed. <br><br><a href="http://i.imgur.com/ZcY6iuK.png" rel="colorbox"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZcY6iuK.png"></a><br><strong>Raid placement on the Bug Family.</strong><br><br><strong>Vem Last</strong><br>This is the easiest of all paths to take and recommended to those new to the battle. Position the raid according to the illustration and initiate the pull. Quickly dispatch of Lord Kri, making sure to stay away from his front and the poison cloud that spawns upon death. The boss will be tanked in such a way that the healers can avoid receiving the damage from Toxic Volley, whereas casters must adjust their placement according to the amount of poison stacks and Nature damage mitigation.<br><br>Yauj takes a little work to bring down, but with some proper tank  transition during the fear there should be no major issues. Upon her death, make sure to use AoE spells (e.g. Hellfire) to clear out her spawns and move onto Vem.<br><br>When only Vem is last, the entire raid must form around as him as close as possible to prevent him running off  towards a caster being far away. This also ensures that all of the warriors can keep him constantly taunted in place. Continue with this strategy until Vem soon falls.<br><br><strong>Princess Yauj Last</strong><br>This scenario may require some practice, but is not overly difficult. Proceed with the fight as normal, quickly eliminating Kri. Thereafter move into close position around Vem.<br><br>At this point, Yauj will consume Kri. Two or three tanks must be on Vem at all times to alternate between taunts, whereas the rest will focus on Yauj. It’s important to target Vem with ranged attacks while all rogues pile on Yauj, making sure that she is kicked at all times when her claws begin to glow golden in order to interrupt her heal. Assignments can be made internally to ensure that the ability is always available. It is also important to use Fear Ward to ensure that a few rogues and warriors can interrupt during a fear. When Vem dies, Yauj rushes over to consume him and gains the Vengeance ability. The healing strain on the tanks will be quite profound at this point due to the damage amplification, in which pertinent CDs should be used, including Wail of the Banshee.<br><br>

This means that Mages play a significant role in the encounter, but all damage dealers will be useful after acquiring some items and consumables. This boss requires a high Nature Resistance value as it uses AoE poison bolts which have direct damage along with DoTs. He resets if taken outside of his room, meaning that it is possible to run out before an impending wipe.<br><br><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Preparation</span></span><br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/spell_nature_spiritarmor.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"><span style="color: #2cff00;"> Adequate Nature Resistance equipment</span><br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/inv_potion_22.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"><span style="color: #2cff00;">   Greater Nature Protection Potion</span> x2 (One pre-popped, one if the first one has been depleted)<br><br><img src="%20http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/inv_potion_12.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"> <span style="color: #2cff00;">Elixir of Poison Resistance</span> Used for the purpose of dispelling the Poison DoT during the encounter (does not share cooldown with other consumables and can currently be used indefinitely on Kronos without incurring the intended cooldown.

Viscidus hits very fast at first, but progressively slows down.<br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/spell_nature_acid_01.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"> <span style="color: #2cff00;">Poison Shock:</span> AoE Nature attack that deals ~1200 Nature damage. Has a radius of 15 yards - be careful to stay away from Viscidus when not trying to shatter him once frozen.<br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/spell_nature_corrosivebreath.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"> <span style="color: #2cff00;">Poison Bolt Volley:</span> AoE spell cast every 10 seconds that hits for resistible ~1500 Nature damage and applies a dispellable DoT that deals ~500 Nature damage every 2 seconds for 10 seconds, similar to Lord Kri and Princess Huhuran. The volley ignores LoS and has a range of 100 yards. Nature Resist gear can greatly mitigate the direct damage, but the DoT is unresistable and therefore highly lethal.  Poison curing must be set up for the raid so that no one is hit by more than one tick of the DoT, including the use of Elixir of Poison Resistance. <br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_creature_disease_02.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"> <span style="color: #2cff00;">Summon Toxic Slime:</span> Toxin Clouds are spewed out every 30-40 seconds, dealing ~1500 unresistable damage and reduces movement speed by 40%. This ability is similar to Lord Kri’s Death Special. A single bolt will predate the Toxin Cloud, so it is possible to move away from the landing point. The clouds look fairly small, but the damaging area is far greater than the visual representation of the zone. <br><br><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Strategy</span></span><br><br>Circle the raid around Viscidus and unleash as many ice based attacks as possible upon him. Melee will use Frost Oil and Frost-proc weapons (e.g. Coldrage Dagger) to compensate for their lack of spells while other casters can use ice damage based wands. Mages should use their Rank 1 Frost Bolt, Frost Nova and Cone of Cold to freeze Viscidus as quickly as possible due to the fact that the strength of the abilities is irrelevant.<br><br>Anyone that can cleanse poison should be doing it actively as much as possible to mitigate Poison Bolt Volley, including the usage of Elixir of Poison  Resistance. The Toxic Slime should be avoided at all costs and can be countered by having the main tank dragging Viscidus around and keeping him mobile during the fight. <br><br><strong>Slowing Phase</strong><br>The goal is to freeze him solid, and the progress is indicated by his attack and movement speed slowing down along with various messages. These are linked to different phases, described below:<br><br>"V<em>iscidus begins to slow.</em>" - Movement and attack speed reduced by 15%. This phase begins after 100 frost abilities were used against the boss.<br><br>"<em>Viscidus is freezing up.</em>" - Movement and attack speed reduced by 30%. This phase begins after 150 frost abilities were used against the boss.<br><br>"<em>Viscidus is frozen solid.</em>" - Movement and attacks cease completely. At this point the raid must switch to melee attacks to shatter him. This phase begins after 200 frost abilities were used against the boss.<br><br><strong>Frozen Phase</strong><br>When he is frozen solid, every damage dealer in the raid must close in upon him and use melee attacks and other abilities, e.g. Goblin Sapper Charge and Crystal Force, to prevent him from thawing out. When Viscidus has received enough damage, he shatters into an army of smaller Globs. Destroy as many as possible while they make their way to the center to reform Viscidus. They will move slowly at first, but continuously and steadily gathering speed over time.<br><br>Messages that indicate the progress will also appear similar to the Slowing Phase in the following manner: <br><br>"<em>Viscidus begins to crack.</em>" - Continue melee attacks.<br><br>"<em>Viscidus looks ready to shatter.</em>" - Continue melee attacks.<br><br>"<em>Viscidus explodes.</em>" - Viscidus shatters into multiple small "Globs of Viscidus" in a circle around the room.  Once they reach the center, he will be reformed.<br><br><strong>Shattering Phase and Globs of Viscidus</strong><br>Every time Viscidus is shattered, he splits into 1-20 Globs of Viscidus, each one representing 5% of his HP. Each Glob takes 10K-15K damage to kill and is immune to all slows and stuns. Destroy as many as possible while they make their way to the center to reform Viscidus, making sure to focus fire as dealing damage to one has no effect unless it is killed. They will move slowly at first, but continuously and steadily gathering speed over time. Eventually he becomes smaller and smaller while spawning less and less Globs, indicating the total progress of the encounter.<br><br>

This is Ouro’s deadliest attack. It can be fully resisted or not - damage is not reduced/blocked since it has an incapacitating effect that makes it a binary spell. Ouro uses the ability in the direction of the person with the highest threat and being hit by Sand Blast clears all threat for that person. It is generally cast every 20-25 seconds and has 45 yards range, meaning it can easily be outranged. Healers should immediately begin to heal those hit.<br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/spell_nature_thorns.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"> <span style="color: #2cff00;">Sweep:</span> Ouro unleashes a melee attack, dealing 1K-2.5K damage and causing anyone in range to be knocked away. This often results in a temporary aggro switch to the ranged group, which could be lethal due to Sand Blast. If Ouro is not engaged by some sort of melee combat for five seconds, he burrows under the ground prematurely, causing a great amount of havoc. It is also crucial that the tank that was swept does not go into melee range due to the fact that Ouro will return to that warrior, and chances are that this player is not at full health.<br><br><img src="http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090111204534/wowwiki/images/a/a4/BTNCryptFiendBurrow.png" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"> <span style="color: #2cff00;">Burrow:</span> Every 1.5 minutes or 3 minutes, Ouro retreats underground for 30 seconds, becoming untargettable and undamagable. He will not submerge if he is busy casting Sand Blast or Sweep, but will do so in the case of no player being in melee range of the boss. <br><br>During this time the raid will be avoiding the Dirt Mound Quakes. Make sure the entire raid converges upon the center of the room ten seconds before he re-emerges, so that the point he chooses to burst forth from is predictable and not in the vicinity of a wall. If this were to happen, positioning can be tricky to maintain.<br><br><img src="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/c/c5/Spell_nature_earthquake.png/revision/latest?cb=20060930182205" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"> <span style="color: #2cff00;">Dirt Mound Quake:</span> When Ouro burrows, he sends out a series of quakes that deal ~1500 Nature damage. Spread out and head for the walls when this happens, but make sure to head back to the center of the room before he emerges again.<br><br><img src="http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/c/c5/Spell_nature_earthquake.png/revision/latest?cb=20060930182205" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"> <span style="color: #2cff00;">Ground Rupture:</span> When Ouro emerges from a Burrow, anyone caught under him receives 2000 physical damage. This damage is rarely fatal, so normally it is preferable to soak it in order to maintain proper positioning of the boss.<br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/trade_engineering.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"> <span style="color: #2cff00;">Scarab Swarm:</span> As Ouro emerges from his burrow, he spawns sixteen Scarabs, dealing 300 physical damage on cloth and 40-150 on tanks. Tauntable for a short time, but will pick an initial target and stick to them for the whole duration. Since they deal moderately low damage, they should be handled using crowd control while proper positioning is established. While it is possible to defeat these Scarabs and can be done so with relative ease, they despawn on their own after 45 seconds.<br><br><strong>Phase 2</strong><br><br><img src="http://wow.zamimg.com/images/wow/icons/large/ability_druid_challangingroar.jpg" style="width: 25px;height: 25px;"> <span style="color: #2cff00;">Berserk:</span> At 20% health, Ouro gains 150% increased attack speed and 100% increased damage. If his primary target pulls back out of melee range, he’ll launch boulders at that player dealing ~6000 physical damage (similar to the Ragnaros encounter). Ouro does not burrow anymore at this point, but will unleash Dirt Mound Quakes, Sand Blasts and Scarabs the entire time. Keeping the main tank is paramount during this phase.<br><br><span style="color: #3366ff;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Strategy</span></span><br><br>This is an encounter that requires proper raid positioning along with reacting to each of his abilities. It is important that the off-tanks are standing 90 degrees from the main tank on both respective sides during the pull to avoid receiving damage from Sand Blast. The raid should be positioned using 3 groups spread with 120 degrees between them to prevent the number of deaths in case the positioning goes wrong. <br><br><a href="http://i.imgur.com/NSWICmQ.png" rel="colorbox"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NSWICmQ.png"></a><br><strong>Raid placement on Ouro.</strong><br><br>The ranged DPS need to burn down the boss as much as possible during the intervals when he is up without the need to worry about pulling aggro. This is because Ouro will not move to engage someone at range, and is therefore unaffected by the threat table.<br>Melee DPS is more tricky in the sense that they want to avoid the Sweep ability, meaning that they only have a few moments to deal damage to Ouro. Even then, the boss’ aggro is unpredictable for anyone in melee range, meaning that he can easily turn to a player and obliterate them in one or two hits if off-tanks are unable to taunt him in time and move him to the main tank position.<br><br>When Ouro does burrow, staying alive takes precedence over everything else. It is important to mitigate as much damage as possible from the Dirt Mound Quakes by constantly moving around, and Greater Nature Protection Potions can be used if need be.<br><br>In order to determine where Ouro will surface, it is imperative that everyone in the raid stays in the center of the room as the submerging phase is about to end. Once he appears, multiple tanks will be on Ouro at all times to ensure that he does not submerge more than necessary. The Scarabs will predominantly be handled with crowd control abilities since they despawn after 45 seconds, e.g. fear, frost novas, frost traps.<br><br>During the second phase at 20% health, healers and ranged DPS should stay in position as best as possible while making sure not to stand still for an extended period to prevent receiving damage from Dirt Mound Quake. Melee DPS should now use all cooldowns available, e.g. Recklessness and Execute while the main tank uses Shield Wall. Ouro has roughly 400K damage in this phase, meaning that he can be taken down quite quickly with adequate DPS from the all of the cooldowns used.
